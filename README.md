# ConfigurationsExample

This is a simple small project that demonstrates one of the ideas how settings for an application
could be read and used in a software.

For this purpose a consol application is used to demonstrate one of the use cases.

The reason why this was created is because reading settings is usually not to big of a deal for developers.
But personally I got some problems mocking those steps, so as a result, this very small but custom solution
was made, where settings both can be quite effictivelly read and as well Mocked out without interfering
with other testing steps to the software.

Feel free to explore the solution and get the gist of what is going on with settings reading, while taking note
that the main operations and the whole reason this project was made in the first place, are stored in the
ConfigurationsAssistant folder.
